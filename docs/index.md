# \# Store Econometrics Simulation and Evaluation

# 

# Welcome to Michael Belli's data science and econometrics portfolio.  

# This project uses a simulated panel dataset of retail stores to demonstrate:

# 

# \- How data-generating processes (DGPs) work  

# \- How different econometric models estimate (or fail to correctly estimate) the true effects  

# \- How model misspecification affects inference  

# \- The difference between naive OLS and properly specified fixed-effects models  

# 

# This site will include:

# 

# \### 📘 Technical Section (with code)

# \- Data generation process (DGP)

# \- Naive OLS model

# \- Two-way fixed effects model (TWFE)

# \- Model evaluation metrics

# \- Visualizations

# \- Code for all models

# 

# \### 📙 Non-Technical Section (no code)

# \- Business-focused explanations

# \- Key results and takeaways

# \- Visualizations only

# \- Why certain models work better

# 

# \### 🏆 Model Comparison

# \- Side-by-side RMSE

# \- R² comparisons

# \- Coefficient recovery: |β\_est − β\_true|

# \- Champion vs. Naive visualization

#
