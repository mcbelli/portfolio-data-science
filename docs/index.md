# \# Store Econometrics Simulation and Evaluation

# 

# Welcome to Michael Belli’s data science and econometrics portfolio.

# 

# This project uses a simulated panel dataset of retail stores to demonstrate:

# 

# \- How data-generating processes (DGPs) work  

# \- How different econometric models estimate (or fail to correctly estimate) true effects  

# \- How model misspecification affects inference  

# \- The difference between naive OLS and properly specified fixed-effects models  

# 

# ---

# 

# \## 📘 Technical Section (with full code)

# 

# This section contains:

# 

# \- Data Generation Process (DGP)

# \- Naive OLS model

# \- Two-way fixed effects (TWFE) model

# \- Model evaluation metrics

# \- Visualizations showing model performance

# \- Full Python code

# 

# You can explore the models here:

# 

# \- \[OLS Naive Model](models/ols\_naive.md)

# \- \[Two-Way Fixed Effects Model](models/twfe\_full.md)

# 

# \## 📙 Non-Technical Section (no code)

# 

# This version is designed for product owners, executives, and non-technical audiences.  

# It summarizes the key insights and business meanings \*without any code.\*

# 

# Coming soon:

# 

# \- High-level explanation of the DGP  

# \- Visualizations of model behavior  

# \- Simple explanation of why TWFE beats OLS  

# \- Practical business takeaways  

#

# 

# \## 🏆 Model Comparison

# 

# Once both models are implemented, you’ll be able to view:

# 

# \- RMSE comparisons  

# \- R² comparisons  

# \- Coefficient recovery: \\|β\_est − β\_true\\|  

# \- Visual “Champion vs. Naive” summary
